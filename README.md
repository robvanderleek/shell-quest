In Shell Quest, a wide range of topics from computing history and modern
software engineering are explored through the user interface found on all
computers: The Shell.

Shell Quest is meant to be read like an â€˜80s computer magazine, these magazines
came with cassette tapes or floppy disks that contained the software discussed
in the magazine. This was fun because you could immediately try out what you
were reading about. Likewise, each issue of Shell Quest comes with a Docker
image that bundles all the software for that issue, installed and ready to run
ðŸš€
